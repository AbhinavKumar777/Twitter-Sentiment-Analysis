# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
The **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** project is designed to analyze public sentiment from tweets. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this project identifies and classifies tweets into different sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis can be applied to understand trends, public opinion, and user feedback in real time.

## Features
- **Dataset-Based Analysis:** Uses an available dataset containing pre-collected tweets.
- **Preprocessing and Analysis:** Clean and preprocess tweets, then classify them into sentiment categories using machine learning models or pre-trained NLP libraries.
- **Visualization:** Generate insightful charts and graphs to represent sentiment distribution.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `nltk`
  - `WordCloud`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbhinavKumar777/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place the dataset file in the project directory:
   - Ensure the dataset file is named `train.csv` or update the script configurations accordingly.

## Usage
Run the script to preprocess the dataset, perform sentiment analysis, and visualize results, all in one go:
   ```bash
   python twitter_sentiment_analysis.py
   ```
